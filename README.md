# Airplane-Connections-Java-
Consists of:
This program is able to calculate the cheapest flight cost for flights with 0 to 2 scales. It allows the user to add airports and flights, and to calculate queries based on the information in the database.
Notes: This project originally had a functioning Java version, which was lost. The project regulates the access to the database through the use of a password system. In addition to calculating the cheapest flight, the program also allows the user to find out how much each state is being served, update the cost of flights, change airline names, and add and delete flights. The project originally also had a functioning 3 scale flight option which was left unfinished when the software was initially designed.
Tools: MySQL, C++
• Uses a MySQL database with all the flights, airports, and flight costs
• Asks queries with condition statements to find the cheapest option
