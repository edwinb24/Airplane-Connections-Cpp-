There is a porblem with the execution of the option 6, when the user choose flies with 2 scales

I make the project going from the ones I concider easier parts to the harder ones, and each time I send a query to SQL, I before
try the query on the Commands. 

I work in the project just in three period of times:
the first day I made almost all the project doing all the options except the #6, for the 2nd day I work in researchs about #6, and
make the flies with 1 scale, for the third day I make the flies with 2 scales and try to do the ones with 3.

Note: To run it MAYBE is necesary to put the main.cpp file in the desktop and the folder "Project" next to it in the desktop too...
